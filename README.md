2. **Implement the following in `main.c`**:
    - Function to calculate the factorial of a number.
    - Function to check if a number is prime.
    - Function to generate a Fibonacci series up to a given number.

3. **Compile and run your code**:
    ```sh
    gcc main.c -o main
    ./main
    ```

### 🛠️ C++

    g++ main.cpp -o main
    ./main
    ```

### ☕ Java
1. **Navigate to the `java` directory**:
    ```sh
    cd java
    ```
2. **Implement the following in `Main.java`**:
    - Method to calculate the factorial of a number.
    - Method to check if a number is prime.
    - Method to generate a Fibonacci series up to a given number.

3. **Compile and run your code**:
    ```sh
    javac Main.java
    java Main
    ```

## 📝 Submission
1. Complete the implementation in each directory.
2. Commit and push your changes to your repository:
