## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/infoyouth/assignments.git
```
### 2. Create a New Branch
Create a new branch for your assignment to keep your work organized and separate from the main branch. Follow these steps:

a. Open your terminal or command prompt.

b. Make sure you are in the repository directory:
    ```sh
    cd assignments
    ```

c. Create a new branch with a meaningful name:
    ```sh
    git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
    ```
    Replace `<your-branch-name>` with a descriptive name for your branch, such as `feature/python-assignment1`.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Use branch names that reflect the task or feature you are working on to keep things organized.

### 3. Make Changes
Navigate to the folder for your assignment (e.g., `python`, `c`, `cpp`, `java`) and make the necessary changes. Follow these steps:

a. Open your terminal or command prompt.

b. Navigate to the directory for the language you are working on:
    ```sh
    cd <language-directory>
    ```
    Replace `<language-directory>` with the appropriate folder name, such as `python`, `c`, `cpp`, or `java`.

c. Make the necessary changes to your code files as per the assignment instructions.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Regularly save your work and test your code to ensure it meets the assignment requirements.

### 4. Add and Commit Your Changes
Once you have made the necessary changes to your code files, you need to stage and commit your changes. Follow these steps:

a. Stage your changes by adding them to the Git staging area:
    ```sh
    git add .
    ```

b. Commit your changes with a descriptive message explaining the updates:
    ```sh
    git commit -m "Completed Assignment 1 in Python"
    ```

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Write clear and concise commit messages that describe the changes you made. This helps you and others understand the purpose of each commit.
